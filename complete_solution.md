# Complete Fix for Supabase RLS Error in 3 Words Game

I've implemented a comprehensive solution to fix the RLS error and make sure word entries are properly saved. Here's what you need to do:

## 1. Fix the Supabase RLS Policy

This is the most important step! You need to run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- First, ensure RLS is enabled on the table
ALTER TABLE words ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Remove any existing policies that might be conflicting
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all actions" ON words;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow inserts and reads" ON words;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow insert and read" ON words;

-- Create a new policy that allows all operations
CREATE POLICY "public_words_policy" 
ON words
FOR ALL
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);
```

## 2. Code Improvements Already Made

I've already made these improvements to your code:

1. Added better error handling in the play page
2. Added table existence checking before operations
3. Enhanced the error messages to be more specific about RLS issues
4. Improved the localStorage fallback for when Supabase operations fail
5. Added error logging to localStorage for troubleshooting

## 3. Testing the Fix

After running the SQL commands above:
1. Try submitting a new entry on the play page
2. Check if it shows up on the results page
3. If you still see errors, look at the browser console for detailed information

The primary issue was the RLS policy, which the SQL commands above will fix.
