# Complete Fix for Supabase RLS and Data Saving Issues

Follow these steps to solve both the Row Level Security policy error and ensure both player and friend data are saved properly:

## Step 1: Fix the RLS Policy in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Create a "New Query"
5. Copy and paste this SQL command exactly as written:

```sql
-- Make sure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE words ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Remove any existing policies to avoid conflicts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "public_words_policy" ON words;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "enable_all_access_policy" ON words; 
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all actions" ON words;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow inserts and reads" ON words;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow insert and read" ON words;

-- Create a completely new policy with a unique name
CREATE POLICY "unrestricted_words_access" 
ON words
FOR ALL
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Verify the policy was created
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'words';
```

6. Click "Run" to execute the query

## Step 2: What I've Fixed in the Code

I've made these improvements to fix the data saving issues:

1. **Home Page (Player's Own Words)**:
   - Added Supabase integration to save the player's own words to the database
   - Marked player entries with "(Self)" for easy identification
   - Added error handling specific to RLS issues
   - Improved loading state and error messaging

2. **Play Page (Friend's Words)**:
   - Enhanced error handling for better RLS error detection
   - Added fallback to localStorage when Supabase operations fail
   - Added detailed error logging for troubleshooting

3. **Results Page**:
   - Improved the fetch logic to get all entries including the player's own words
   - Added fallback to localStorage when Supabase operations fail
   - Enhanced error handling and loading states

## Step 3: Check That Everything Works

After running the SQL commands and refreshing your app:

1. Try the whole flow from the beginning:
   - Enter your own name and 3 words on the home page
   - Share the link with a friend
   - Have them enter their name and 3 words
   - Check the results page to see both your words and their words

2. If you still encounter issues:
   - Check the browser console for any error messages
   - Verify the table exists in Supabase with the correct columns
   - Ensure your Supabase URL and key are correct in the app

## How This Fixes the Issues

The solution addresses both problems by:
1. Creating a proper unrestricted RLS policy that allows all database operations
2. Saving both the player's own words and their friends' words to Supabase
3. Providing fallbacks to localStorage in case of any database issues

This ensures a complete data saving and retrieval system that works even if Supabase has temporary issues.
